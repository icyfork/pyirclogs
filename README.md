## Description

A Python script that will log an IRC room; it will record everything said,
including joins, parts, mode, and topic changes.

## Installation

Requires Python `IRCLib`, `sudo apt-get install python-irclib` on Ubuntu,
and should be similar on most other distributions of GNU/Linux.

For Windows, `easy_install irclib`
(or simply grab IRClib from the downloads section)

## Usage

Instructions of how to use:

1. Edit the script, to fill in the values `network`, `nick`, `password`, etc.
2. Make sure `irclib` is installed (if it isn't installed, you will know when you run it).
3. `python script.pl`.
4. Collect logs.
5. ???
6. Profit!

## About this mirror on Github

My name is *Ky-Anh Huynh*. On Github I am @icy.

I found this project on Google Group when looking for a `simple bot`
for the project <https://githug.com/theslinux>. The bot must be simple
enough to run on <http://berlios.de/> servers where I don't have permission
to install anything new.

Because I need to edit the script to make it to work with my configuration,
and the project doesn't release source code in any repository (FIXME),
I create this mirror on `Github` that may help me and the community.

While preparing this repository I know *Chris Oliver* also has its own `bot`.
I will take a look if it works on my servers. His work seems to be great.
